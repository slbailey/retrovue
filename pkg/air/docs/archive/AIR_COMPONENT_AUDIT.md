# Air Component Audit (superseded by Architecture Reference)

**Status:** Superseded. This document was a one-time audit snapshot. The **canonical reference** for first-class components, boundaries, and architecture is:

- **[Air Architecture Reference Contract](architecture/AirArchitectureReference.md)** — The reference contract for Air: first-class components, gRPC surface, ownership, directory structure, and invariants. Use that document for onboarding, design review, and contract alignment.

The Architecture Reference is maintained as the standing contract; it is not an audit or findings document. For current authority, use the Architecture Reference and the codebase.

## Where to go

| Need | Document |
|------|----------|
| First-class components, gRPC, ownership, directory layout | [architecture/AirArchitectureReference.md](architecture/AirArchitectureReference.md) |
| Standing architecture contracts (PlayoutEngine, OutputBus, ProgramFormat, etc.) | [contracts/architecture/](contracts/architecture/README.md) |
| Development phase contracts (Phase 6A, Phase 8) | [contracts/phases/](contracts/phases/README.md) |
| Docs index | [README.md](README.md) |
