# Phase 3 - Real decode and renderer complete

## Purpose

Summarize the outcomes of Phase 3, which delivered full FFmpeg decoding, Renderer integration, and production-ready telemetry.

## Delivered

- `FFmpegDecoder` with multi-codec support (H.264, HEVC, VP9) and resolution scaling.
- `FrameRenderer` implementations for headless validation and preview display, orchestrated by `PlayoutControlImpl`.
- `MetricsHTTPServer` exposing Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`, including render timing, buffer depth, and decode failures.
- Enhanced `ChannelWorker` lifecycle coordinating decode, buffer, render, and telemetry threads.

## Validation

- Integration rehearsals stream real media end-to-end with <10 ms decode latency at 1080p30.
- Contract suites extended to cover decode/renderer rule IDs; all pass.
- Manual observability checks confirm metrics parity with Renderer expectations.
- Stress tests run multiple channels concurrently without buffer underruns.

## Follow-ups

- Harden error recovery (slate insertion, retry budget) ahead of Phase 4.
- Add automated latency dashboards using exported metrics.
- Coordinate with RetroVue Core for MasterClock integration and multi-channel scheduling.
