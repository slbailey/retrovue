# Protobuf definitions

**Single canonical source:** `playout.proto` — gRPC contract between Core (Python) and the playout engine (Air, C++).

- **Edit only** `playout.proto`; do not duplicate it elsewhere.
- **Generate stubs:** from repo root run `sh scripts/air/generate_proto.sh`
  - Python → `pkg/core/core/proto/retrovue/`
  - C++ → generated by `pkg/air` CMake in the build directory
