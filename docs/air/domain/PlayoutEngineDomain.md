# Domain — Playout Engine

Status: Enforced

## Purpose

This document defines the **domain-level contract** for the RetroVue Playout Engine — the native C++ subsystem responsible for decoding media assets and delivering frame streams to the Renderer. It establishes core entities, relationships, invariants, lifecycle guarantees, threading models, and telemetry expectations that govern the playout engine's behavior within the RetroVue runtime.

The playout engine executes segment-based instructions from the ChannelManager (LoadPreview, SwitchToLive); it does not understand schedules or plans. ChannelManager computes PlayoutSegments and sends exact execution instructions. The engine produces continuous, clock-aligned frame streams from heterogeneous producers (file-backed and programmatic). It ensures deterministic decode, maintains thread-safe buffering, and exposes comprehensive telemetry for operator visibility and runtime health monitoring.

---

## Core Entities

The playout engine domain consists of six primary entities:

### 1. Channel

**Purpose**: Represents a single broadcast channel worker that manages decode, buffering, and frame delivery for one logical channel.

**Ownership**: Each Channel instance owns:

- Two `ProducerSlot` instances (preview and live) for dual-producer switching
- One `FrameRingBuffer` (staging queue, shared by both producers)
- One `FrameRenderer` reference (output consumer, receives frames from live slot only)
- One telemetry state object

**Identity**: Uniquely identified by a numeric `channel_id` (int32) issued by the ChannelManager.

**State Machine**:

| State       | Description                                              |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ready`     | Channel is actively decoding and delivering frames       |
| `buffering` | Channel is rebuilding buffer depth after underrun        |
| `error`     | Fatal error occurred; channel awaiting retry or shutdown |
| `stopped`   | Channel has been gracefully shut down                    |

**State Transitions**:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> ready: StartChannel
    ready --> buffering: Buffer underrun
    buffering --> ready: Buffer recovered
    ready --> error: Decode failure
    error --> ready: Retry successful
    error --> stopped: Max retries exceeded
    ready --> stopped: StopChannel
    buffering --> stopped: StopChannel
```

**Invariants**:

- A Channel must have exactly one `FrameRingBuffer` when state is `ready` or `buffering`
- When state is `ready` or `buffering`, the live slot must contain a producer (preview slot may be empty or loaded)
- Only the FrameRouter writes frames to the ring buffer; FrameRouter pulls from live slot producer; preview slot producer runs in shadow decode mode
- Preview slot producer decodes frames but FrameRouter does not pull from it until switched to live
- Ring buffer persists through producer switches (never flushed during switch)
- PTS must be continuous across producer switches (no jumps, no resets)
- Channel state transitions are atomic and immediately reflected in telemetry
- Channels cannot transition from `stopped` to any other state (terminal state)

---

### 2. Frame

**Purpose**: Represents a single decoded video frame with associated timing and provenance metadata.

**Structure**:

```cpp
struct Frame {
    uint8_t* data;           // YUV420 planar frame data
    size_t size;             // Total buffer size in bytes
    FrameMetadata metadata;  // Timing and provenance
};

struct FrameMetadata {
    int64_t pts;             // Presentation timestamp (microseconds)
    int64_t dts;             // Decode timestamp (microseconds)
    double duration;         // Frame duration (seconds)
    std::string asset_uri;   // Source asset identifier
    int width;               // Frame width in pixels
    int height;              // Frame height in pixels
};
```

**Lifecycle**:

1. **Decode**: Frame is allocated and decoded by `FrameProducer` (made available via pull API)
2. **Route**: `FrameRouter` pulls frame from active producer and writes to `FrameRingBuffer`
3. **Consume**: Frame is popped by `FrameRenderer` for output
4. **Release**: Frame memory is freed after rendering

**Invariants**:

- PTS must be monotonically increasing within a single asset stream
- DTS ≤ PTS for all frames
- Duration must be positive and non-zero
- Frame data must be in YUV420 planar format (Y, U, V planes)
- Width and height must match channel configuration

---

### 3. Plan / Segment

**Purpose**: Air does not understand schedules or plans. Canonical control is segment-based: ChannelManager computes **PlayoutSegments** (asset_path, start_offset_ms, hard_stop_time_ms) and sends execution instructions via `LoadPreview` and `SwitchToLive`. Optionally, a plan handle (opaque reference) may be used with `StartChannel` or `UpdatePlan` where that path is supported.

**Representation**: Segment: explicit fields in `LoadPreviewRequest`. Plan (when used): string handle (e.g., `"morning_block"`, `"plan_uuid_123"`) resolved by ChannelManager.

**Usage**:

- **Segment-based (canonical):** `LoadPreview` carries asset_path, start_offset_ms, hard_stop_time_ms; `SwitchToLive` is control-only, no payload.
- **Plan-based (optional):** `StartChannel` / `UpdatePlan` may pass plan_handle; engine treats as opaque and does not compute schedule time.

**Invariants**:

- When segment-based: Air seeks by offset, stops at or before hard_stop_time_ms; clock authority lives in Python (MasterClock).
- Invalid asset path or segment data results in channel `error` or failed gRPC response.

---

### 4. Renderer

**Purpose**: Consumer interface that pulls decoded frames from the playout engine and packages them for output (MPEG-TS, preview window, etc.).

**Interface Contract**:

```cpp
class FrameRenderer {
public:
    virtual ~FrameRenderer() = default;

    // Pull next frame from channel buffer
    virtual bool pull_frame(int channel_id, Frame& out_frame) = 0;

    // Check if renderer is ready to accept frames
    virtual bool is_ready() const = 0;

    // Get current buffer consumption rate (frames/second)
    virtual double get_fps() const = 0;
};
```

**Implementations**:

- `MPEGTSRenderer`: Packages frames into MPEG-TS streams
- `PreviewRenderer`: Displays frames in debug window (OpenGL/SDL)
- `HeadlessRenderer`: Consumes frames without output (testing)

**Expectations**:

- Renderer must maintain minimum consumption rate to prevent buffer overflow
- Renderer pulls frames at MasterClock-aligned intervals
- Renderer must handle frame timing metadata (PTS/DTS) correctly

**Invariants**:

- Renderer must not block decode threads
- Frame consumption rate must exceed decode rate by ≥ 5% to prevent buffer buildup
- Renderer must gracefully handle buffer underruns (return false on `pull_frame`)

---

### 5. Metrics

**Purpose**: Telemetry data exposed via Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint for monitoring channel health, performance, and timing accuracy.

**Core Metrics**:

| Metric Name                               | Type      | Labels    | Unit    | Description                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `retrovue_playout_channel_state`          | Gauge     | `channel` | enum    | Current channel state: 0=stopped, 1=buffering, 2=ready, 3=error |
| `retrovue_playout_buffer_depth_frames`    | Gauge     | `channel` | frames  | Number of frames currently staged in ring buffer                |
| `retrovue_playout_frame_gap_seconds`      | Gauge     | `channel` | seconds | Deviation from MasterClock scheduled PTS                        |
| `retrovue_playout_decode_failure_count`   | Counter   | `channel` | count   | Total decode errors since channel start                         |
| `retrovue_playout_frames_decoded_total`   | Counter   | `channel` | frames  | Total frames successfully decoded                               |
| `retrovue_playout_frames_dropped_total`   | Counter   | `channel` | frames  | Frames dropped due to buffer overflow                           |
| `retrovue_playout_buffer_underrun_total`  | Counter   | `channel` | count   | Number of buffer underrun events                                |
| `retrovue_playout_decode_latency_seconds` | Histogram | `channel` | seconds | Time from packet read to frame ready                            |
| `retrovue_playout_channel_uptime_seconds` | Gauge     | `channel` | seconds | Time since channel entered `ready` state                        |

**Update Frequency**:

- State metrics: Updated immediately on state change
- Buffer metrics: Updated on every push/pop operation
- Counters: Incremented atomically
- Histograms: Sampled per-frame

**Invariants**:

- Metrics must be thread-safe (atomic updates)
- Metrics endpoint must respond within 100ms
- All metrics must include `channel` label for multi-channel deployments

---

### 6. MasterClock

**Purpose**: Single source of truth for time synchronization; **MasterClock lives in the Python runtime**. The playout engine uses it to align frame PTS with scheduled broadcast time and to enforce deadlines (e.g. hard_stop_time_ms). Air does not compute schedule time.

**Interface** (consumed from RetroVue runtime):

```cpp
class MasterClock {
public:
    // Get current UTC time (microseconds since epoch)
    virtual int64_t now_utc_us() const = 0;

    // Get current local time (microseconds since epoch)
    virtual int64_t now_local_us() const = 0;

    // Convert UTC to local time
    virtual int64_t to_local(int64_t utc_us) const = 0;

    // Calculate offset from scheduled time
    virtual int64_t offset_from_schedule(int64_t scheduled_pts) const = 0;
};
```

**Usage**:

- Frame PTS is compared against `now_utc_us()` to compute `frame_gap_seconds`
- Renderer uses MasterClock to determine when to pull next frame
- Telemetry uses MasterClock for `channel_uptime_seconds`

**Guarantees**:

- Time never goes backward (monotonic)
- All returned timestamps are timezone-aware
- Precision: microsecond resolution

**Invariants**:

- Playout engine must never call system time functions directly (`time()`, `gettimeofday()`, etc.)
- All timing calculations must use MasterClock
- Clock skew between runtime and engine must be ≤ 50ms

## Entity Relationships

The following diagram illustrates ownership and communication paths:

```mermaid
graph TD
    CM[ChannelManager] -->|StartChannel| Channel
    CM -->|UpdatePlan| Channel
    CM -->|StopChannel| Channel
    CM -->|LoadPreview| Channel
    CM -->|SwitchToLive| Channel

    Channel -->|owns| PreviewSlot[Preview Slot]
    Channel -->|owns| LiveSlot[Live Slot]
    Channel -->|owns| Buffer[FrameRingBuffer]
    Channel -->|owns| FrameRouter[FrameRouter]
    Channel -->|references| Renderer
    Channel -->|publishes| Metrics

    PreviewSlot -->|contains| PreviewProducer[Preview Producer<br/>shadow decode]
    LiveSlot -->|contains| LiveProducer[Live Producer<br/>running]

    LiveProducer -->|decodes| Frame
    PreviewProducer -->|decodes| Frame
    FrameRouter -->|pulls from| LiveProducer
    FrameRouter -->|writes| Buffer
    Buffer -->|stores| Frame
    Renderer -->|pulls from| Buffer

    PreviewProducer -->|consumes| Plan
    LiveProducer -->|consumes| Plan
    LiveProducer -->|uses| MasterClock
    Renderer -->|uses| MasterClock
    Metrics -->|uses| MasterClock
```

**Key Relationships**:

1. **Channel → ProducerSlot** (1:2 ownership - preview and live)

   - Channel manages two producer slots: preview and live
   - Preview slot holds next prepared asset running in **shadow decode mode**
     - Decodes frames internally but FrameRouter does not pull from it (shadow mode)
     - Caches first decoded frame
     - Aligns PTS to continue from live producer's last PTS
   - Live slot holds currently active producer (decodes frames, exposes pull API)
   - **FrameRouter** pulls frames from live producer and writes to ring buffer
   - Producers are created via factory pattern and can be any `IProducer` implementation
   - Producers expose pull-based API (e.g., `nextFrame()`) - they do NOT write to buffer directly
   - Channel stops producers on shutdown
   - FrameRouter switches which producer it pulls from during seamless switch (no buffer flush)

2. **Channel → FrameRingBuffer** (1:1 ownership)

   - Channel allocates buffer on startup
   - Buffer size is configurable per channel
   - Channel destroys buffer on shutdown

3. **Channel → FrameRenderer** (N:1 reference)

   - Multiple channels may share one Renderer
   - Renderer is owned by playout service
   - Channel holds weak reference
   - Renderer only consumes frames from live slot producer

4. **ProducerSlot → IProducer** (1:1 ownership per slot)

   - Preview slot: Contains producer that is loaded but not started
   - Live slot: Contains producer that is running and outputting frames
   - Both slots can contain any `IProducer` implementation (VideoFileProducer, etc.)
   - Producers are created via factory pattern

5. **IProducer → Plan** (N:1 consumption)

   - Producer resolves plan to asset list
   - Multiple producers may use same plan (different channels)
   - Plan is immutable during decode

6. **FrameRingBuffer → Frame** (1:N storage)
   - Buffer stores multiple frames simultaneously
   - Frame ownership transfers: live producer → buffer → renderer
   - Preview producer does not write to buffer during shadow decode (isolated)
   - Buffer persists through producer switches (never flushed during switch)
   - Writer pointer is swapped atomically: `[last_live_frame][first_preview_frame][...]`
   - Frames are freed after renderer consumes

---

## Lifecycle Guarantees

### Channel Lifecycle

**Startup** (`StartChannel`):

1. Validate channel_id and plan_handle
2. Allocate FrameRingBuffer (default: 60 frames)
3. Set producer factory for creating VideoFileProducer instances
4. Load initial asset into preview slot via `loadPreviewAsset()`
5. Activate preview as live via `activatePreviewAsLive()` (backward compatibility: first asset goes live immediately)
6. Start live producer's decode thread
7. Transition to `buffering` state
8. Once buffer reaches minimum depth (30 frames), transition to `ready`
9. Emit `retrovue_playout_channel_state{channel="N"} = 2` (ready)

**Execution** (steady state):

1. Producer continuously decodes frames (makes available via pull API)
2. FrameRouter pulls frames from live producer and writes to ring buffer
3. Renderer continuously pulls and renders frames
4. Buffer maintains depth between 30-60 frames
5. Metrics updated on every operation
6. State remains `ready` unless error or underrun

**Plan Update** (`UpdatePlan`):

1. Set channel state to `buffering`
2. Drain remaining frames from current plan
3. Swap plan reference in producer
4. Resume decode from next scheduled segment
5. Rebuild buffer to minimum depth
6. Transition back to `ready`
7. Expected downtime: ≤ 500ms

**Preview Load** (`LoadPreview`):

1. Validate channel_id, asset_path, start_offset_ms, hard_stop_time_ms (segment payload)
2. Destroy any existing preview producer
3. Create new producer via factory with specified asset_path and segment parameters
4. Start producer in **shadow decode mode** (decodes frames but does not write to buffer)
5. Producer decodes first frame and caches it; respects start_offset_ms and hard_stop_time_ms (Air enforces deadlines; MasterClock in Python)
6. Store producer in preview slot (running in shadow mode)
7. Preview slot is ready for switching with first frame decoded and ready

**Switch to Live** (`SwitchToLive`) - Seamless Algorithm:

1. Validate channel_id (control-only; no segment payload)
2. Preview producer must have decoded at least one frame (shadow decode complete)
3. Get last PTS from live producer: `last_live_pts = live.nextPTS()`
4. Align preview producer PTS: `preview.alignPTS(last_live_pts + frame_duration)`
5. FrameRouter pulls last frame from live producer and writes to buffer (if needed)
6. **FrameRouter switches producer**: `router.active_producer = preview` (atomic)
7. Preview producer exits shadow mode, begins exposing frames via pull API
8. Live producer stops decoding gracefully (wind down)
9. Move preview producer to live slot
10. Reset preview slot to empty
11. Expected switch time: ≤ 100ms for seamless playout

**Critical Requirements**:
- **Slot switching occurs at a frame boundary, and the engine guarantees that the final LIVE frame and first PREVIEW frame are placed consecutively in the output ring buffer with no discontinuity in timing or PTS.**
- Ring buffer is **NOT flushed** during switch (persists through switch)
- Renderer pipeline is **NOT reset** (continues reading seamlessly)
- PTS continuity is **mandatory** (no jumps, no resets to zero)
- Preview producer's first frame PTS = last_live_pts + frame_duration
- No visual discontinuity, no black frames, no stutter

**Shutdown** (`StopChannel`):

1. Set state to `stopped`
2. Signal decode thread to stop
3. Drain remaining frames from buffer
4. Join decode thread (timeout: 5s)
5. Release FrameProducer and FrameRingBuffer
6. Emit final metrics snapshot
7. Emit `retrovue_playout_channel_state{channel="N"} = 0` (stopped)

---

### Threading Model

The playout engine uses a **multi-threaded, lock-free** architecture:

**Thread Roles**:

| Thread              | Purpose                           | Count per Channel |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Main / gRPC         | Handles control plane requests    | 1 (shared)        |
| Decode Worker (Live)| Decodes frames from live producer | 1 (only live slot producer runs) |
| Metrics Exporter    | Serves `/metrics` endpoint        | 1 (shared)        |
| Renderer (external) | Pulls frames and generates output | 1 (shared)        |

**Note**: 
- Preview slot producer runs in **shadow decode mode** (decodes frames but FrameRouter does not pull from it)
- FrameRouter pulls frames from live slot producer and writes to ring buffer
- Both producers run decode threads and expose pull-based API, but only live producer's frames are routed

**Synchronization**:

- **FrameRingBuffer**: Lock-free circular buffer with atomic head/tail indices
- **State transitions**: Atomic compare-and-swap on state variable
- **Metrics updates**: Atomic increment/store operations
- **No mutexes** in hot path (decode/push/pop operations)

**Thread Safety Guarantees**:

1. **Producer thread** (decode - both slots):

   - Live slot producer: Decodes frames and makes them available via pull API (e.g., `nextFrame()`)
   - Preview slot producer: Decodes frames in **shadow mode** (frames available but not pulled by router)
   - Both producers run decode threads, but only live producer's frames are pulled by FrameRouter
   - Producers do NOT write to buffer directly - they expose pull-based API
   - FrameRouter pulls from active producer and writes to FrameRingBuffer
   - FrameRouter never blocks on buffer full (drops frame and increments counter)
   - Preview producer caches first decoded frame and aligns PTS
   - Atomically updates decode metrics
   - Producer switch is atomic (FrameRouter switches which producer it pulls from)

2. **Consumer thread** (renderer):

   - Exclusively pops from FrameRingBuffer
   - Never blocks on buffer empty (returns false)
   - Atomically updates consumption metrics

3. **Control thread** (gRPC):
   - Can modify channel state atomically
   - Signals decode thread for shutdown
   - Safe to call during active decode

**Deadlock Prevention**:

- No nested locks
- Lock-free buffer eliminates producer-consumer deadlock
- State transitions use atomic operations
- Decode thread is interruptible

---

## Behavior Contracts

### BC-001: Frame Timing Accuracy

**Rule**: Frames delivered to renderer must maintain PTS accuracy within ±16.67ms (one frame @ 60fps) of scheduled time.

**Measurement**: `retrovue_playout_frame_gap_seconds`

**Enforcement**: If gap exceeds threshold:

1. Log warning
2. Increment `retrovue_playout_decode_failure_count`
3. If gap exceeds 5 seconds, transition to `error` state

---

### BC-002: Buffer Depth Guarantees

**Rule**: FrameRingBuffer must maintain depth between 30-60 frames during steady state.

**Minimum depth**: 30 frames (1 second @ 30fps)
**Maximum depth**: 60 frames (2 seconds @ 30fps)

**Enforcement**:

- Underrun (depth < 30): Transition to `buffering`, inject slate
- Overflow (depth > 60): Drop incoming frames, increment `retrovue_playout_frames_dropped_total`

---

### BC-003: Idempotent Control Operations

**Rule**: All gRPC control methods (`StartChannel`, `UpdatePlan`, `StopChannel`, `LoadPreview`, `SwitchToLive`) must be idempotent.

**Examples**:

- `StartChannel` on already-started channel returns success (no-op)
- `StopChannel` on already-stopped channel returns success (no-op)
- `UpdatePlan` with same plan_handle is no-op
- `LoadPreview` with same segment replaces existing preview producer (idempotent in effect)
- `SwitchToLive` (control-only, no payload) returns error if preview not ready or invalid state (no state change)

**Rationale**: Allows ChannelManager to retry failed operations without side effects.

---

### BC-004: Graceful Degradation

**Rule**: Decode failures must not crash the playout engine or other channels.

**Failure Handling**:

1. Catch all decode exceptions within channel worker
2. Transition channel to `error` state
3. Log error with asset_uri and error code
4. Attempt retry up to 5 times with exponential backoff (base: 1s)
5. If retries exhausted, fall back to slate loop
6. Emit `retrovue_playout_channel_state{channel="N"} = 3` (error)

**Cross-channel isolation**: One channel's failure must not affect other channels.

---

### BC-005: Resource Cleanup

**Rule**: All resources (memory, file handles, decoder contexts) must be released on channel shutdown.

**Resources**:

- Decoder contexts (e.g. libav/FFmpeg when used by file-backed producers)
- Frame buffers (YUV420 data)
- Thread handles

**Verification**: No memory leaks detected after 1000 start/stop cycles (valgrind clean).

---

### BC-006: Monotonic PTS

**Rule**: Frame PTS must be strictly monotonically increasing within a single asset stream.

**Enforcement**:

- Producer validates PTS on every frame
- If PTS decreases or duplicates, log error and skip frame
- Increment `retrovue_playout_decode_failure_count`

**Exception**: PTS may reset when transitioning between assets (plan update or producer switch).

### BC-007: Dual-Producer Switching Seamlessness

**Rule**: Switching from preview to live must occur at ring buffer boundary with perfect PTS continuity and no visual discontinuity.

**Enforcement**:

- **Slot switching occurs at a frame boundary, and the engine guarantees that the final LIVE frame and first PREVIEW frame are placed consecutively in the output ring buffer with no discontinuity in timing or PTS.**
- Preview producer must decode in **shadow mode** before switch (first frame decoded and cached)
- Preview producer PTS must align: `preview_first_pts = live_last_pts + frame_duration`
- Ring buffer is **NOT flushed** during switch (persists through switch)
- Ring buffer writer pointer is swapped atomically: `ringbuffer.writer = preview`
- Renderer pipeline is **NOT reset** (continues reading seamlessly)
- Last live frame and first preview frame appear back-to-back in buffer
- Switch completes within 100ms for seamless playout
- No PTS jumps, no resets to zero, no negative deltas
- No visual pop, no black frame, no stutter

**Seamless Switch Algorithm**:
1. Preview producer decodes until ready (shadow mode)
2. Preview producer aligns PTS to continue from live producer
3. Acquire ring buffer writer lock
4. Write last frame from live (if needed)
5. Swap writer pointer atomically
6. Preview exits shadow mode, begins writing
7. Live producer stops gracefully

**Exception**: First asset loaded via `StartChannel` goes directly to live (backward compatibility).

### Metric Semantics

**State Encoding**:

- `0` = stopped
- `1` = buffering
- `2` = ready
- `3` = error

**Frame Gap** (`frame_gap_seconds`):

- Positive value: Frame is ahead of schedule (buffer buildup)
- Negative value: Frame is behind schedule (decode lag)
- Target: ≤ ±0.016 seconds (16ms)

**Buffer Depth** (`buffer_depth_frames`):

- Healthy range: 30-60 frames
- Warning: < 30 frames (underrun risk)
- Critical: < 10 frames (imminent underrun)

**Decode Latency** (`decode_latency_seconds`):

- Measures time from `av_read_frame()` to `push()` completion
- Target p95: ≤ 25ms
- Target p99: ≤ 50ms

---

## Versioning and Compatibility

### API Versioning

**Version Constant**: `PLAYOUT_API_VERSION` (defined in `protos/playout.proto`)

**Current Version**: `1.0`

**Compatibility Rules**:

1. **Backward-compatible changes** (patch/minor):

   - Add new optional fields to messages
   - Add new metrics
   - Performance improvements
   - Bug fixes

2. **Backward-incompatible changes** (major):
   - Remove or rename message fields
   - Change field semantics
   - Remove metrics
   - Change state machine behavior

**Version Check**:

- ChannelManager sends `PLAYOUT_API_VERSION` in gRPC metadata
- Playout engine validates version on every request
- Mismatch results in `FAILED_PRECONDITION` gRPC status

### Proto Schema Contract

**Authoritative Source**: `protos/playout.proto` (repo root)

**Generation**:

- C++ stubs: `protoc --cpp_out=src/proto/`
- Python stubs: `sh scripts/air/generate_proto.sh` → `pkg/core/core/proto/retrovue/`

**Synchronized Releases**:

- Schema changes require coordinated releases of:
  - `retrovue-core` (Python runtime)
  - `retrovue-air` (C++ engine)

**Validation**:

- CI enforces proto compatibility checks
- Breaking changes block merge without version bump

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Error Categories

| Category        | Description                           | Recovery Strategy                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Decode Error    | Decode failure (e.g. file-backed producer; corrupt frame) | Skip frame, continue decode        |
| Asset Not Found | Plan references missing asset         | Transition to error, inject slate  |
| Buffer Overflow | Producer outpaces consumer            | Drop frames, log warning           |
| Buffer Underrun | Consumer outpaces producer            | Inject slate, transition buffering |
| Plan Invalid    | Cannot resolve plan_handle            | Return gRPC error, stay stopped    |
| Thread Crash    | Decode thread exits unexpectedly      | Attempt restart, max 5 retries     |

---

### Retry Policy

**Exponential Backoff**:

```
retry_delay = base_delay * (2 ^ attempt_count)
base_delay = 1.0 seconds
max_retries = 5
max_delay = 32 seconds
```

**Example Timeline**:

- Attempt 1: Wait 1s
- Attempt 2: Wait 2s
- Attempt 3: Wait 4s
- Attempt 4: Wait 8s
- Attempt 5: Wait 16s
- Give up, transition to `error` permanently

**Retry Triggers**:

- Decode thread crash
- Asset open failure
- Plan resolution failure

**No Retry**:

- Invalid plan_handle (immediate error response)
- `StopChannel` during retry (cancel retry, stop immediately)

---

### Slate Fallback

**Purpose**: Provide continuous output during asset failures or buffer underruns.

**Slate Source**: Static PNG image converted to YUV420 loop.

**Activation**:

1. Detect error condition (asset failure, underrun)
2. Transition to `buffering` state
3. Start slate injection loop (30fps, repeated frame)
4. Continue slate until:
   - Asset recovery succeeds, OR
   - Buffer rebuilds to minimum depth, OR
   - `StopChannel` is called

**Slate Frame**:

- Resolution: Matches channel configuration (e.g., 1920x1080)
- Format: YUV420 planar
- Content: "Technical Difficulties" or channel logo

## Performance Expectations

### Latency Targets

| Operation        | Target Latency | Measurement                           |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| StartChannel     | ≤ 2s           | gRPC request to first frame delivered |
| UpdatePlan       | ≤ 500ms        | gRPC request to resumed decode        |
| StopChannel      | ≤ 1s           | gRPC request to thread joined         |
| Frame Decode     | ≤ 25ms (p95)   | `decode_latency_seconds` histogram    |
| Buffer Push      | ≤ 1ms          | `push()` duration                     |
| Buffer Pop       | ≤ 1ms          | `pop()` duration                      |
| Metrics Endpoint | ≤ 100ms        | HTTP GET `/metrics` response time     |

---

### Throughput Targets

| Metric                   | Target               | Constraint                      |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Decode Throughput        | ≥ 60 fps per channel | Sustained, no frame drops       |
| Multi-channel Capacity   | ≥ 4 channels         | On 4-core CPU @ 3.0 GHz         |
| Memory per Channel       | ≤ 100 MB             | Steady state, buffer + decoder  |
| CPU per Channel (decode) | ≤ 25% of 1 core      | H.264 1080p30                   |
| Metrics Update Rate      | ≥ 10 Hz              | Buffer depth, frame gap updates |

---

### Scalability

**Horizontal Scaling**:

- Run multiple playout engine processes
- Each process handles 1-4 channels
- Channels assigned via load balancer or static config

**Vertical Scaling**:

- Decode threads scale with CPU cores
- Buffer size scales with available memory
- Metrics endpoint remains single-threaded

**Limits**:

- Max channels per process: 8 (reasonable)
- Max frame resolution: 4K (3840x2160)
- Max decode throughput: 240 fps aggregate (all channels)

---

## Testing and Validation

### Unit Tests

**Coverage Requirements**:

- FrameRingBuffer: 100% line coverage
- FrameProducer: ≥ 90% line coverage
- State transitions: All paths tested
- Error handling: All error codes tested

**Test Files**:

- `tests/test_buffer.cpp`: Ring buffer operations
- `tests/test_decode.cpp`: Decode pipeline (e.g. file-backed producer)
- `tests/test_metrics.cpp`: Telemetry export
- `tests/test_lifecycle.cpp`: Channel start/stop/update

---

### Integration Tests

**Scenarios**:

1. **Happy path**: Start → Decode → Render → Stop
2. **Plan update**: Start → Decode → UpdatePlan → Resume → Stop
3. **Underrun recovery**: Start → Force underrun → Inject slate → Recover
4. **Error recovery**: Start → Force decode error → Retry → Recover
5. **Multi-channel**: Start 4 channels → Verify isolation → Stop all

**Validation**:

- Frame PTS monotonicity
- Buffer depth within bounds
- Metrics accuracy
- No memory leaks (valgrind)
- Thread safety (ThreadSanitizer)

---

### Contract Tests

**Purpose**: Verify gRPC contract compliance with ChannelManager expectations.

**Tests**:

- `test_start_channel_contract.py`: Validates `StartChannel` behavior
- `test_update_plan_contract.py`: Validates `UpdatePlan` behavior
- `test_stop_channel_contract.py`: Validates `StopChannel` behavior
- `test_idempotency_contract.py`: Validates idempotent operations
- `test_telemetry_contract.py`: Validates metrics format and accuracy

**Assertions**:

- Response fields match proto schema
- State transitions follow state machine
- Metrics are updated correctly
- Error messages are actionable

---

## Design Principles

1. **Deterministic behavior**: Same inputs produce same outputs; no hidden state.
2. **Thread safety**: Lock-free data structures; atomic operations for shared state.
3. **Graceful degradation**: Errors isolate to affected channel; no cascading failures.
4. **Observable**: Comprehensive metrics; all state changes logged and exposed.
5. **Testable**: Unit, integration, and contract tests cover all critical paths.
6. **Performance-first**: Hot paths avoid allocations, locks, and blocking I/O.
7. **Clock-aligned**: All timing driven by MasterClock; no system time dependencies.
