# Retrovue Standards

## Purpose

This directory defines the shared documentation, testing, and methodology standards used across all Retrovue projects.

## Core Standards

*   **[contributing.md](contributing.md):** The workflow for proposing, reviewing, and maintaining documentation and code, including the AI-assisted development process.
*   **[documentation-standards.md](documentation-standards.md):** The canonical tone, structure, and formatting rules for all documentation.
*   **[repository-conventions.md](repository-conventions.md):** The canonical directory structure, naming rules, and cross-repo alignment.
*   **[test-methodology.md](test-methodology.md):** The testing strategy, validation workflow, and database usage rules.

## Templates

The `templates` directory contains reusable templates for common document types:

*   **[architecture.md](templates/architecture.md):** For architecture documents.
*   **[changelog.md](templates/changelog.md):** For changelog entries.
*   **[dev-notes.md](templates/dev-notes.md):** For development notes and incident reports.
*   **[readme.md](templates/readme.md):** For component and package READMEs.
