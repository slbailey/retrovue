<!-- Add items below -->

- **Continuity announcer.** AI-generated continuity announcements during tier-2 schedule buildout; voice is injected over the end of the last segment of a TV show. Requires a custom iFrameEnricher.

- **Expand iFrameEnricher: waterbug + lower third.** Add a waterbug enricher and a lower-third enricher; compose them like Photoshop layers inside the frame before it’s handed to the output ring buffer.
