# LAW-DECODABILITY

## Constitutional Principle

Output must always be decodable by a standards-compliant consumer.

## Implications

- TS packets are structurally valid.
- PAT/PMT are discoverable.
- First emitted video frame after attach or switch is decodable (IDR).
- Audio format is house-compliant.

## Violation

Emission of transport stream data that cannot be decoded by a compliant client.
