Task ID: P11C-002
Rule ID: INV-BOUNDARY-DECLARED-001
Subsystem: Build
Task Type: BUILD
File(s) to Modify: scripts/air/generate_proto.sh, pkg/core/retrovue/generated/
Owner: Build
Blocked By: P11C-001

Instructions:
- Regenerate proto stubs for Python (Core) and C++ (AIR)
- Verify stubs compile correctly
- Verify existing tests still pass

---

Rule Definition:
legacy switch RPC MUST include `target_boundary_time_ms` parameter.

Regeneration Steps:

1. Run proto generation script:
   ```bash
   sh scripts/air/generate_proto.sh
   ```

2. Verify C++ stubs updated:
   ```bash
   grep -r "target_boundary_time_ms" pkg/air/build/
   ```

3. Verify Python stubs updated:
   ```bash
   grep -r "target_boundary_time_ms" pkg/core/retrovue/generated/
   ```

4. Rebuild AIR:
   ```bash
   cmake --build pkg/air/build -j$(nproc)
   ```

5. Run AIR tests:
   ```bash
   ctest --test-dir pkg/air/build --output-on-failure
   ```

6. Run Core tests:
   ```bash
   cd pkg/core && pytest tests/
   ```

Verification Checklist:
- [ ] Proto stubs regenerated
- [ ] C++ includes new field accessor
- [ ] Python includes new field accessor
- [ ] AIR builds successfully
- [ ] AIR tests pass
- [ ] Core tests pass

Done Criteria:
Proto stubs regenerated; all tests pass; new field accessible in both Python and C++.

Completion (2026-02-01): generate_proto.sh run (Python with venv); C++ stubs built via CMake. All contract tests pass.
