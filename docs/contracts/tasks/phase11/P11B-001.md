Task ID: P11B-001
Rule ID: INV-BOUNDARY-TOLERANCE-001, INV-P8-SWITCH-TIMING
Subsystem: PlayoutEngine
Task Type: FIX
File(s) to Modify: protos/playout.proto, pkg/air/src/runtime/PlayoutEngine.cpp
Owner: AIR

Instructions:
- Add `switch_completion_time_ms` field to SwitchToLiveResponse proto
- Populate field with wall-clock time when switch actually completed
- This enables measuring delta from target boundary

---

Rule Definition:
Grid boundary transitions MUST complete within one video frame duration (33.33ms at 30fps) of the absolute scheduled boundary time.

Proto Change:
```protobuf
message SwitchToLiveResponse {
  bool success = 1;
  ResultCode result_code = 2;
  string message = 3;
  bool pts_contiguous = 4;
  int64 switch_completion_time_ms = 5;  // NEW: wall-clock ms when switch completed
}
```

Implementation:
1. In PlayoutEngine::SwitchToLive(), capture completion time:
   ```cpp
   auto completion_time = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();
   response.set_switch_completion_time_ms(
       std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(
           completion_time.time_since_epoch()).count());
   ```

2. Regenerate proto stubs after proto change

Constraints:
- Use steady_clock for consistency
- Capture time AFTER switch is complete (not when RPC received)
- Time must reflect when output actually transitioned

Done Criteria:
SwitchToLiveResponse includes switch_completion_time_ms populated with completion wall-clock time.
