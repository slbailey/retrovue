Task ID: P11B-006
Rule ID: INV-BOUNDARY-TOLERANCE-001
Subsystem: Operations
Task Type: ANALYSIS
File(s) to Modify: (none - analysis task)
Owner: Ops
Blocked By: P11B-005

Instructions:
- Analyze baseline data from P11B-005
- Determine what % of switches are >1 frame late
- Identify root causes of violations
- Recommend go/no-go for Phase 11D enforcement

---

Rule Definition:
Grid boundary transitions MUST complete within one video frame duration (33.33ms at 30fps) of the absolute scheduled boundary time.

Analysis Questions:

1. What percentage of switches exceed 33ms delta?
2. What percentage exceed 100ms? 500ms? 1000ms?
3. Are violations correlated with:
   - Specific channels?
   - Time of day?
   - Content type (long vs short segments)?
   - System load?
4. What is the distribution shape?
   - If bimodal: what causes the second mode?
   - If long tail: what causes outliers?

Root Cause Investigation:
- For switches >100ms late, correlate with:
  - LoadPreview timing (prefeed lead time)
  - Buffer depth at switch time
  - CPU load during switch
  - Disk I/O during switch

Recommendation Template:
```
Baseline Summary:
- Violation rate: [X]%
- p99 delta: [X]ms

Root Causes Identified:
1. [cause] - [frequency] - [severity]
2. [cause] - [frequency] - [severity]

Recommendation: [GO / NO-GO / CONDITIONAL] for Phase 11D

Rationale:
[explanation]

Prerequisites for GO:
- [list of fixes/mitigations needed]
```

Done Criteria:
Analysis complete with documented recommendation for Phase 11D enforcement.

Completion (2026-02-01):
- **Status:** Blocked by P11B-005 (OPS baseline). No baseline data yet; recommendation for Phase 11D will be written after P11B-005 is completed.

---

**Dependency Clarification:**
This task does NOT block Phase 11D code implementation. It blocks production enablement.

The recommendation from this task determines:
- **GO:** Enable `use_deadline_authoritative_switch=true` in production
- **CONDITIONAL:** Enable with specific mitigations first
- **NO-GO:** Do not enable until specific issues are resolved

Phase 11D code should be written and tested regardless. The feature flag provides the safety valve.
