Task ID: P11A-002
Rule ID: INV-AUDIO-SAMPLE-CONTINUITY-001
Subsystem: FileProducer, FrameRingBuffer
Task Type: LOG
File(s) to Modify: pkg/air/src/producers/file/FileProducer.cpp, pkg/air/src/buffers/FrameRingBuffer.cpp
Owner: AIR
Blocked By: P11A-001

Instructions:
- Add audio sample drop detection logging
- Log MUST fire if any audio sample/frame is discarded
- Do not fix the drop behavior yet (that's P11A-003)
- This task is observability only

---

Rule Definition:
Audio sample continuity MUST be preserved during normal operation. Audio samples MUST NOT be dropped due to queue backpressure.

Log Specifications:

1. Audio queue overflow detection:
```
[FileProducer] INV-AUDIO-SAMPLE-CONTINUITY-001 VIOLATION: Audio frame dropped, queue_depth=%d, queue_capacity=%d, pts=%ld
```

2. Audio sample drop counter (if applicable):
```
[FrameRingBuffer] Audio queue overflow: dropped_count=%d, total_dropped=%d
```

Implementation Notes:
- Add counter for dropped audio frames
- Log on each drop occurrence
- Include queue state in log for diagnosis
- Do NOT change drop behavior (yet)

Done Criteria:
Any audio sample drop is logged with INV-AUDIO-SAMPLE-CONTINUITY-001 VIOLATION prefix and queue state.
