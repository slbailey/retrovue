Task ID: P11A-001
Rule ID: INV-AUDIO-SAMPLE-CONTINUITY-001
Subsystem: FileProducer, FrameRingBuffer
Task Type: AUDIT
File(s) to Modify: (none - audit only)
Owner: AIR

Instructions:
- Audit current audio queue behavior under backpressure conditions
- Document findings in this file's "Findings" section below
- Do not modify code in this task
- Identify specific code paths where audio samples may be dropped

---

Rule Definition:
Audio sample continuity MUST be preserved during normal operation. Audio samples MUST NOT be dropped due to queue backpressure. Queue overflow MUST trigger producer throttling, not sample loss.

Audit Scope:
1. FileProducer audio decode path
2. FrameRingBuffer audio queue behavior when full
3. Any TryPush vs Push semantics for audio
4. Backpressure signaling between audio and video paths

Questions to Answer:
1. What happens when the audio queue is full and a new audio frame arrives?
2. Is there any code path that discards audio samples?
3. Are audio and video backpressure handled symmetrically?
4. What logging exists for audio queue overflow conditions?

Files to Examine:
- pkg/air/src/producers/file/FileProducer.cpp (audio decode loop)
- pkg/air/src/buffers/FrameRingBuffer.cpp (queue behavior)
- pkg/air/src/buffers/FrameRingBuffer.h (API contract)

Findings:
(To be filled in during task execution)

Done Criteria:
Document identifies all code paths where audio samples could be dropped under backpressure, or confirms none exist.
