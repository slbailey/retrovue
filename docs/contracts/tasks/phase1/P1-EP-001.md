- Do not refactor
- Do not add logs unless explicitly requested
- Do not change production behavior unless task type = FIX
- Stop immediately after task passes

Rule Definition:
Channel defines house audio format; all audio must be normalized to house format before reaching OutputBus; EncoderPipeline never negotiates format - it rejects non-conforming input.

Test Scenario:
- Given: EncoderPipeline configured with house format (48000 Hz, stereo, AAC)
- When: Audio frame with non-house format (e.g., 44100 Hz) is submitted
- Then: Frame is rejected with explicit error
- And: No output packet is produced

Assertions Required:
1. EncoderPipeline initialized with house format 48000 Hz
2. Submit audio frame with sample_rate = 44100 Hz
3. EncodeAudio returns error code (not success)
4. No audio packet produced in output
5. Encoder remains in valid state (not faulted) for future valid frames

Constraints:
- Use existing test harness patterns
- Do not modify EncoderPipeline implementation
- Test rejection path, not acceptance path
- Verify encoder can still accept valid frames after rejection

Done Criteria:
Test asserts non-house audio format rejected with error code, no output packet produced.
