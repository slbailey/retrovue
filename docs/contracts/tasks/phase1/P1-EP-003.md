Task ID: P1-EP-003
Rule ID: INV-AUDIO-HOUSE-FORMAT-001
Subsystem: EncoderPipeline
Task Type: TEST
File(s) to Modify: pkg/air/tests/contracts/MpegTSPlayoutSink/MpegTSPlayoutSinkContractTests.cpp
Test or Log Name: TEST_INV_AUDIO_HOUSE_FORMAT_001_ExplicitRejection

Instructions:
- Implement exactly one atomic task
- Modify ONLY the listed file(s)
- Do not refactor
- Do not add logs unless explicitly requested
- Do not change production behavior unless task type = FIX
- Stop immediately after task passes

Rule Definition:
All audio reaching EncoderPipeline must be house format; non-house input must be explicitly rejected (not silently dropped or resampled).

Test Scenario:
- Given: EncoderPipeline initialized with house sample rate
- When: Audio frame with sample_rate != house_sample_rate is submitted
- Then: Encoder explicitly rejects the frame
- And: Rejection is indicated by return value (not silent drop)

Assertions Required:
1. Configure house_sample_rate = 48000
2. Submit frame with sample_rate = 22050 (clearly wrong)
3. Return value indicates rejection (error code or false)
4. Frame was not silently consumed
5. No resampling occurred (output sample rate matches input if any output)

Constraints:
- Use existing test harness patterns
- Do not modify EncoderPipeline implementation
- This tests the CONTRACT behavior (explicit rejection), not just LAW (format enforcement)
- Distinct from P1-EP-001: this verifies rejection is explicit, not silent

Done Criteria:
Test asserts explicit rejection path when sample_rate != house_sample_rate.
