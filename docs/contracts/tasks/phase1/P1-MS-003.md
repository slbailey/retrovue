Task ID: P1-MS-003
Rule ID: LAW-VIDEO-DECODABILITY
Subsystem: MpegTSOutputSink
Task Type: VERIFY
File(s) to Modify: (none - verification only)
Test or Log Name: N/A

Instructions:
- This is a VERIFY task - no code changes required
- Review existing test coverage
- Document findings
- Report whether verification passes or fails

---

Rule Definition:
Every segment starts with IDR; real content gates pad; AIR owns keyframes. The TS output must be decodable by standard players (VLC, ffplay).

Verification Checklist:
1. [ ] Locate existing tests for video decodability / IDR-first
2. [ ] Confirm test verifies first video frame in TS is IDR
3. [ ] Confirm test verifies TS packets have valid sync byte (0x47)
4. [ ] Confirm test verifies TS packet size is 188 bytes
5. [ ] Confirm test parses PAT/PMT successfully

Files to Review:
- pkg/air/tests/contracts/Phase84PersistentMpegTsMuxTests.cpp
- pkg/air/tests/contracts/MpegTSPlayoutSink/MpegTSPlayoutSinkContractTests.cpp

Expected Evidence:
- Test named like "TsValidity" or "Decodable" or "IDR"
- Assertion checking packet[0] == 0x47
- Assertion checking packet size == 188
- Assertion that PAT/PMT can be parsed
- Assertion that first video frame is keyframe/IDR

Done Criteria:
Confirmed: test asserts IDR present at segment boundary, TS valid with 0x47 sync.

If Verification Fails:
Create follow-up task to add missing TS validity or IDR-first test.
