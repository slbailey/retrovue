Task ID: P1-MS-001
Rule ID: INV-P9-BOOT-LIVENESS
Subsystem: MpegTSOutputSink
Task Type: LOG
File(s) to Modify: pkg/air/src/output/MpegTSOutputSink.cpp
Test or Log Name: INV-P9-BOOT-LIVENESS log statement

Instructions:
- Implement exactly one atomic task
- Modify ONLY the listed file(s)
- Do not refactor
- Do not add tests unless explicitly requested
- Do not change production behavior
- Stop immediately after log is added

---

Rule Definition:
Newly attached sink must emit decodable TS within bounded time. This ensures viewers see content quickly after tune-in.

Log Specification:
When the first decodable TS packet is emitted after sink attachment, log the event with timing information.

Log Format:
```
[MpegTSOutputSink] INV-P9-BOOT-LIVENESS: First decodable TS emitted at wall_time=%ld, latency_ms=%d
```

Log Level: INFO (significant operational event)

Location:
At the point where the first TS packet is written to output after sink start/attach. Calculate latency from sink attach time to first packet emit time.

Required Fields:
- wall_time: timestamp when packet emitted (microseconds or milliseconds)
- latency_ms: time elapsed since sink was attached

Constraints:
- Add exactly one log statement
- Requires tracking sink attach timestamp (may need to store in member variable)
- Do not modify control flow
- Do not add metrics
- Use existing logging macros/patterns in the codebase

Done Criteria:
Log emitted with wall_time and latency_ms when first decodable TS packet sent.
