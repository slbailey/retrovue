Task ID: P1-EP-002
Rule ID: LAW-AUDIO-FORMAT
Subsystem: EncoderPipeline
Task Type: LOG
File(s) to Modify: pkg/air/src/playout_sinks/mpegts/EncoderPipeline.cpp
Test or Log Name: LAW-AUDIO-FORMAT violation log

Instructions:
- Implement exactly one atomic task
- Modify ONLY the listed file(s)
- Do not refactor
- Do not add tests unless explicitly requested
- Do not change production behavior
- Stop immediately after log is added

---

Rule Definition:
Channel defines house audio format; all audio must be normalized to house format before reaching OutputBus; EncoderPipeline never negotiates format.

Log Specification:
When an audio frame with non-house format is rejected, emit a log with the received format and expected format.

Log Format:
```
[EncoderPipeline] LAW-AUDIO-FORMAT VIOLATION: Received format=%d Hz, expected house_format=%d Hz
```

Log Level: WARN (this is a violation that should be investigated)

Location:
In the audio encoding path, at the point where format validation fails and frame is rejected.

Constraints:
- Add exactly one log statement
- Include both received and expected sample rates
- Do not modify control flow
- Do not add metrics
- Use existing logging macros/patterns in the codebase

Done Criteria:
Log emitted with received vs expected format when non-house audio rejected.
