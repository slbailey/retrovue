Task ID: P1-PO-003
Rule ID: INV-P10-SINK-GATE
Subsystem: ProgramOutput
Task Type: LOG
File(s) to Modify: pkg/air/src/renderer/ProgramOutput.cpp
Test or Log Name: INV-P10-SINK-GATE log statement

Instructions:
- Implement exactly one atomic task
- Modify ONLY the listed file(s)
- Do not refactor
- Do not add tests unless explicitly requested
- Do not change production behavior
- Stop immediately after log is added

---

Rule Definition:
ProgramOutput must not consume frames from the buffer before a sink is attached.

Log Specification:
When a frame's CT has arrived but cannot be consumed because no sink is attached, emit a log.

Log Format:
```
[ProgramOutput] INV-P10-SINK-GATE: Frame CT=%ld not consumed - no sink attached
```

Log Level: DEBUG or TRACE (not WARN - this is legal behavior pre-attach)

Location:
In the render loop, at the point where a frame would be consumed but sink is null.

Constraints:
- Add exactly one log statement
- Do not modify control flow
- Do not add metrics
- Use existing logging macros/patterns in the codebase

Done Criteria:
Log emitted with CT value when frame not consumed due to missing sink.
