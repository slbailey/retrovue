Task ID: P1-PE-001
Rule ID: INV-P8-ZERO-FRAME-BOOTSTRAP
Subsystem: PlayoutEngine
Task Type: LOG
File(s) to Modify: pkg/air/src/runtime/PlayoutEngine.cpp
Test or Log Name: INV-P8-ZERO-FRAME-BOOTSTRAP log statement

Instructions:
- Implement exactly one atomic task
- Modify ONLY the listed file(s)
- Do not refactor
- Do not add tests unless explicitly requested
- Do not change production behavior
- Stop immediately after log is added

---

Rule Definition:
When a segment has frame_count=0 (no content), the CONTENT-BEFORE-PAD gate must be bypassed to allow immediate pad frame emission. Without this bypass, output would deadlock waiting for content that will never arrive.

Log Specification:
When a zero-frame segment is detected and the CONTENT-BEFORE-PAD gate is bypassed, log the event.

Log Format:
```
[PlayoutEngine] INV-P8-ZERO-FRAME-BOOTSTRAP: Zero-frame segment detected, CONTENT-BEFORE-PAD gate bypassed
```

Log Level: INFO (significant operational event, not an error)

Location:
At the point where SetNoContentSegment(true) is called or equivalent logic that bypasses the content gate for zero-frame segments.

Constraints:
- Add exactly one log statement
- Log should fire once per zero-frame segment, not repeatedly
- Do not modify control flow
- Do not add metrics
- Use existing logging macros/patterns in the codebase

Done Criteria:
Log emitted when zero-frame segment detected and CONTENT-BEFORE-PAD gate bypassed.
