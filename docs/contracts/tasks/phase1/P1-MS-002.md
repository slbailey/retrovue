Task ID: P1-MS-002
Rule ID: INV-P9-AUDIO-LIVENESS
Subsystem: MpegTSOutputSink
Task Type: LOG
File(s) to Modify: pkg/air/src/output/MpegTSOutputSink.cpp
Test or Log Name: INV-P9-AUDIO-LIVENESS log statement

Instructions:
- Implement exactly one atomic task
- Modify ONLY the listed file(s)
- Do not refactor
- Do not add tests unless explicitly requested
- Do not change production behavior
- Stop immediately after log is added

---

Rule Definition:
From the moment the TS header is written, output must contain continuous monotonic audio PTS. Audio stream must be "live" shortly after video.

Log Specification:
When the audio stream becomes live (first audio packet with valid PTS emitted after header), log the event.

Log Format:
```
[MpegTSOutputSink] INV-P9-AUDIO-LIVENESS: Audio stream live, first_audio_pts=%ld, header_write_time=%ld
```

Log Level: INFO (significant operational event)

Location:
At the point where the first audio packet is written to the TS mux after the header has been written.

Required Fields:
- first_audio_pts: PTS value of the first audio packet
- header_write_time: timestamp when TS header was written

Constraints:
- Add exactly one log statement
- Requires tracking header write timestamp
- Only log on FIRST audio packet, not every packet
- Do not modify control flow
- Do not add metrics
- Use existing logging macros/patterns in the codebase

Done Criteria:
Log emitted with first_audio_pts and header_write_time when audio stream goes live.
