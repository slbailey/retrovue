Task ID: P1-MS-004
Rule ID: INV-P9-TS-EMISSION-LIVENESS
Subsystem: MpegTSOutputSink
Task Type: LOG
File(s) to Modify: pkg/air/src/output/MpegTSOutputSink.cpp
Test or Log Name: INV-P9-TS-EMISSION-LIVENESS init log

Instructions:
- Implement exactly one atomic task
- Modify ONLY the listed file(s)
- Do not refactor
- Do not add tests unless explicitly requested
- Do not change production behavior
- Stop immediately after log is added

---

Rule Definition:
First decodable TS packet MUST be emitted within 500ms of PCR-PACE timing initialization. This refines INV-P9-BOOT-LIVENESS with a specific time bound.

Log Specification:
When PCR-PACE timing is initialized, log the start of the 500ms deadline window.

Log Format:
```
[MpegTSOutputSink] INV-P9-TS-EMISSION-LIVENESS: PCR-PACE initialized, deadline=500ms
```

Log Level: INFO (significant operational event)

Location:
At the point where PCR timing is initialized (look for existing "PCR-PACE: Timing initialized" log). Add this log immediately after or alongside.

Required Fields:
- deadline: always 500ms (constant for now)

Constraints:
- Add exactly one log statement
- Store initialization timestamp for use by P1-MS-005 and P1-MS-006
- Do not modify control flow
- Do not add metrics
- Use existing logging macros/patterns in the codebase

Done Criteria:
Log `INV-P9-TS-EMISSION-LIVENESS: PCR-PACE initialized, deadline=500ms` emitted when PCR timing starts.

## Completion

- **Status:** Done
- **Completed:** 2026-02-01
- **Implementation:** Log added in `MpegTSOutputSink.cpp` MuxLoop when `timing_initialized` is set; PCR-PACE init time stored in `g_pcr_pace_init_time` for P1-MS-005/P1-MS-006.
