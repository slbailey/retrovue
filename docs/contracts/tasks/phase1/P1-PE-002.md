Task ID: P1-PE-002
Rule ID: INV-P9-BOOTSTRAP-READY
Subsystem: PlayoutEngine
Task Type: VERIFY
File(s) to Modify: (none - verification only)
Test or Log Name: N/A

Instructions:
- This is a VERIFY task - no code changes required
- Review existing test coverage
- Document findings
- Report whether verification passes or fails

---

Rule Definition:
Readiness for output is defined as: segment commit detected AND buffer contains ≥1 video frame. Deep buffering is NOT required - minimal buffering enables fast startup.

Verification Checklist:
1. [ ] Locate test G9_002 in Phase9OutputBootstrapTests.cpp
2. [ ] Confirm test verifies readiness requires commit detection
3. [ ] Confirm test verifies readiness requires ≥1 video frame
4. [ ] Confirm test verifies readiness does NOT require deep buffering (e.g., 10+ frames)
5. [ ] Confirm test verifies readiness passes with exactly 1 frame

Files to Review:
- pkg/air/tests/contracts/Phase9OutputBootstrapTests.cpp (G9_002_ReadinessSatisfiedAfterCommit)

Expected Evidence:
- Test named G9_002 or similar
- Assertion checking commit generation advanced
- Assertion checking buffer depth >= 1
- Assertion that readiness passes with minimal frames
- No assertion requiring buffer depth >= 10 or similar deep buffering

Done Criteria:
Confirmed: G9_002 test asserts readiness = commit + ≥1 video frame.

If Verification Fails:
Create follow-up task to fix readiness test to match INV-P9-BOOTSTRAP-READY definition.
