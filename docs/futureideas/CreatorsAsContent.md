# RetroVue Use Case: **Creator-Run 24×7 Linear Channels**

---

## ✨ One-Sentence Hook

**Turn a creator’s back catalog into a living TV channel — scheduled, continuous, and community-shaped — instead of a dead archive.**

---

## 💡 The Core Idea

Creators with large libraries of long-form content can run a *24×7* linear channel that behaves like real television—even when they're offline:

- **Always on**
- **Predictable schedule**
- **Viewers can drop in mid-episode**
- **No “choose a VOD” friction**

> This is *broadcast logic*, not playlists.

---

## 📺 Concrete Example

**Imagine:**  
A creator like *CohhCarnage* creates a weekly lineup:

- **Every Monday**
    - *9:00–12:00* → Grand Theft Auto V playthrough
    - *12:00–3:00* → Another long-form game
- *Schedule repeats weekly*

**RetroVue automatically:**
- Plays sessions in sequence
- Resumes correctly across weeks
- Starts viewers at the correct offset
- Stops compute when nobody’s watching

**To the viewer, it feels like:**  
> “GTA Mondays are on.”

---

## 🔄 The Differentiator: Viewer-Influenced Programming

When a playthrough finishes:
- The *time slot* remains
- **Viewers vote** on what replaces it
- Voting only impacts *future schedules*
- Winner locks in at the next *grid boundary*

This preserves:
- Determinism
- Trust
- Broadcast feel

While adding:
- Community ownership
- Anticipation
- “Season change” moments

*Viewers aren’t voting on clips — they’re voting on the channel itself.*

---

## 🏆 Why This Matters (Non-Technical)

### For Creators
- **Back catalog works 24×7**
- No micromanagement
- Feels like running a *network*, not a playlist
- *Brand elevation*: “CohhTV”, not “old VODs”

### For Viewers
- No decision fatigue
- Drop-in viewing
- Shared schedule
- Appointment habits form naturally

---

## 🧐 Why Existing Platforms Don’t Do This

- **YouTube:** infinite choice, zero pacing  
- **Twitch:** live *or* dead air  
- **Algorithms:** kill continuity  
- **Archives:** feel abandoned  

**RetroVue restores:**
- Constraint
- Continuity
- Time as a feature

---

## 🎯 Strategic Framing

> RetroVue is *not* competing with Twitch or YouTube.

Instead, it solves a different problem:

**“How do you make old content feel alive again?”**

This use case aligns perfectly with:
- Nostalgia
- Channel surfing
- Shared experience
- Linear discovery

---

## ✅ Why This Is a Natural Fit for RetroVue

This use case:
- Requires *scheduling rules*
- Requires *deterministic playback*
- Benefits from lazy ffmpeg spin-up
- Depends on as-run logs and continuity
- Rewards *predictability* over algorithms

**In other words:**  
RetroVue doesn’t *enable* this use case —  
*it was built for it*.

## 📝 Keep This In Mind For Later

**This idea becomes relevant when:**
- Talking to large creators
- Positioning RetroVue beyond “retro TV”
- Explaining why linear still matters
- Looking for non-nostalgia monetization paths

**Mental label:**  
> *“Creators as Networks”*
